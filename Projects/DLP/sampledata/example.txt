The first thing you need to know about writing a novel is that there are no easy answers. The second thing you need to know is that there’s no magic formula. Every novel demands its own structure, its own pace, its own way of looking at the world. Stories aren’t generic. Stories are like fingerprints. Every story is unique. And every story has its own shape. So how do you tell what shape your story should take? The short answer is that you have to figure it out for yourself. But the longer answer is that there are ways of figuring it out. Plotting and structuring a novel is like using a road map. You can see where you’re going, you can see where you’ve been, and you can see stops and detours ahead. You hope that you won’t have too many detours, and you hope that you won’t get lost. You might even decide to take a detour, if you spot something interesting off the main road. But without a map, you’re driving blind. You’re driving blind and you’re going to get lost and you’ll end up in the ditch. So let’s start with the map. Let’s start with the shape of stories.

# History about Earth:
The Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula. Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. A "giant impact" collision with a planet-sized body named Theia while Earth was in its earliest stage, also contributed to this. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans. As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a supercontinent. Roughly 750 million years ago (mya), the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540 mya, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart 180 mya.
